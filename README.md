# Named-Entity-Recognition-App
# This project is basically to implement Named Entity Recognition with SpaCy.
Natural language Processing is incredibly important for computers to understand for some reason like:
Form a huge amount of data we can extract useful information and NLP  will be useful for the computers to communicate with humans.
Named Entity Recognition is the process of classifying entities into predefined categories such as person,date,time,location,organization,percentage....
Tools used are :
SpaCy :- Used for fastest NLP framework in Python.
Streamlit :- It is used for user interface for my project.
SpaCy_Streamlit :- It is used for visualizing SpaCy models and to build interactive SpaCy powered apps with Streamlit.
BeautifulSoup, urllib.request :- Web Scraping Packages are used to fetch the text from URL provided.
This app highlights two main functions:-
1. Named Entity Recognition from text.
2. Named Entity Recognition from URL.

Finally the testing of the App through CMD.
